* So to reiterate...

* This is an open-air nature preserve.
* There are several dozen humans living in this preserve, so do be careful
* Humans are capable of thinking or feeling--as many robots are
* Humans only act on instinct, which makes them predictable, but dangerous
* However, humans are complex organisms, and they're part of the beauty of biodiversity on Earth
* It's up to all of us to protect that biodiversity from dying out

* While you're here, please do not interact with the humans in any way.
* The typical human is psychologically disturbed, and interacting with them only disturbs them further
* However, as with all animals, if you don't bother them, they won't bother you.

* Also, please feel free to scan the various flora and fauna you come across.
* Magnetic scanning is restricted to intensities of below 0.5 Teslas
* Active scanning at intensities greater than 1% of the surrounding intensity is not allowed
* Passive scanning in any medium is acceptable and encouraged

* Lastly, please be aware: this region has been experiencing some minor geologial instability
* As long as you take care while you're here, you should have wonderful time, and collect some interesting data
* And when you're finished, either return to this exit, or to the one at the far side of the preserve, to return to the transit system

<More about this place>
* It is an arid desert region called Seattle, which is the name of a mythological human settlement
* In the mythology, Seattle was an aquatic city, filled with robotic slaves and a mild poison humans were fond of consuming to increase their strength
* Of course, even if a settlement called Seattle did once exist, it could not have survived the Great Change.
