But instead, a creeping feeling grew up the base of my spine, and into my skull.

[[Bad | Feel the Itch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" Feel the Itch" tags="" position="717,583" size="100,100">The feeling crept across my shoulders, and into the back of my eyes.  

My vision began failing.  I could not see my hands.  I could not hear.  I felt horror and doom.

I shuddered, and stepped backwards from the feeling.

It was like...it was like being the one who had climbed to the highest point of a jungle gym.

From there, you could observe the others and their small lives, and no one had yet threatened to pull you down, so there was no need to preemptively slink away, to make sure you posessed nothing worth stealing from you.

Each copy was my world, for all I could tell.  They fell away from me.  There were more of them.  That was the only number I could think of: &quot;more&quot;.

Not millions, billions, trillions, or quintillions.  No matter how I described them, where were more.
